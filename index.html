                        Hi! My name is Cristopher Franco and I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Stamford, Connecticut. I studied business administration at Norwalk Community college and after 7 years of being in retail management I've decided to transition into a brand new field which is web development. Working in management I have had to work very closely with people as a team. Being in a leadership role in my current occupation, I learned what skills are needed to manage an effecient workforce. Having acquired knowledge on what makes effective communication and building strong morale within an orginzation has given me the confidence to pursue a different path and take my expertise in a new area. I am excited to learn more on what it means to work in web development and gain all the knowledge I need in order to enter into the industry. Even though I have been conditioned to work directly with people instead of through a screen, I am optimistic that I can carry my competence in teamwork to this new field and hopefully become an asset to any future employer. 
                    </p>
